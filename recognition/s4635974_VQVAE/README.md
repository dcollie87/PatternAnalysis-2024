# VQ-VAE generative model on Hip MRI Study for Prostate Cancer Dataset.

## Project Aim
The aim of this project was to create a generative Vector Quantized - Variational Austoencoder (VQ-VAE) model using the Hip MRI Prostate Cancer Dataset [1]. The model must produce "reasonably clear images" and have a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of over 0.6.
